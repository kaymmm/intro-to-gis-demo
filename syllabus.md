## Introduction

This course will introduce the theory and practice of GIS, with an emphasis on environmental analysis and research. The course will explore ontological, epistemological, and methodological foundations of GIS as both a tool and science. It takes seriously the question of how GIS is used as a way of knowing the world and the implications of its use in various fields to represent and analyze information. Each week will cover both GIS theory and applications, and class time will be similarly split between seminar style discussions and lab work. Because of this dual emphasis, students will be required to complete a final project comprised of both GIS-based maps and analyses, as well as a written report describing the methods, analysis of results, and the implications of the results. 

## Assignments

- Project proposal: a 1-2 page written proposal of the final project, outlining key questions, data and data sources, GIS techniques and analyses, hypotheses and expected results, and a timeline of project milestones.
- Weekly blog posts: each student is responsible for participating in weekly blog discussions based on the schedule discussed in class. Blogging roles rotate on a weekly basis, and include the following:
  - Reflection/commentary: write a reflection or commentary on the assigned readings or lab activities. These should *NOT* be summaries, but rather, critical responses to the ideas or process involved in the week’s assignments. 
  - Map critique: identify and link (with proper citation) a map, visualization, website, data source, etc., that you find interesting and that relates to the week’s assignments. Write a short (generous) critique of this resource. What does it do well? How does it successfully or unsuccessfully employ GIS theory to communicate knowledge, information, or opinions?
  - Project updates: discuss your progress on your final projects. Describe successes, failures, questions, or frustrations. Include some description of activities undertaken, resources you’ve identified, and next steps.
- GIS Tutorial: students will work in pairs to lead a workshop on a GIS concept or technique not covered in the syllabus or labs.
- Final project: a 3,000-5,000 word written report and at least 3 visualizations. The report should provide some background on the chosen topic, key questions, methods and GIS techniques, data and data sources, analysis and results, project limitations, and implications of the results. 
- Project presentation: a short and informal in-class presentation of your final project covering the key points of your research process, results, and implications.
- Participation in class discussions and mini-presentations of lab work.
- Extra credit: contributing through pull-requests or submitting issues via Github on the course materials.

## Software

The majority of labs will use ESRI’s ArcGIS ecosystem, however we will also make use of spreadsheet software such as Excel or Google Sheets, and web-based mapping platforms like CartoDB and Mapbox Studio.
